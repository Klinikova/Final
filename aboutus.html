								<h2>What we believe in</h2>
								
								<p>Vacation can be both expensive as well as economical. Pacific Trails Resort is the family and budget friendly, economical and cost-effective then most regular vacations. </p>
								<p>The reason for this is that during regular vacations you make your own spending decisions, which may not be the most cost-effective and can at times result in money leakage. </p>
								<p>When you visiting Pacific Trails Resort you don't have to worry about things like scheduling, reservations, commutes, waiting in lines, finding locations, etc. Even though you may handle such mundane tasks in your daily life, these tasks become particularly stressful when you are in a new and unfamiliar location. </p>

								<h2>See you soon!</h2>
								
								<p>There are many reasons that Pacific Trails Resort are important! We help our guests to remove ourselves from the familiarity of our usual patterns or surroundings, to set aside time to get away with Mother Nature. </p>
								<p>Often at different points in life, one reason or need may outweigh another. However, there are always valid reasons, no matter what your season of life, that a vacation is very important to schedule, plan, and attend.</p>

				<p>Every moment of our lives can be heightened and improved by our own inner development. Freedom lies in our ability to choose a path that leads to the least suffering for ourselves and others, in both big and small decisions every single day. Instead of getting bogged down and lost, we can learn to stop, reorient, and go inside to find our balance and inner wisdom. We can make choices that are healthy and constructive, guided by a deep inner knowing, rather than haphazard or even, at times, unseen destructive tendencies and habits.</p>
